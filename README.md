# Learn to Containerize Web Apps in Baby Steps
In this repo we will learn to build containerized web apps using Node.ja and Express.
We will also learn to deploy them in the Kubernetes cloud. According to the analyst firm RedMonk, 71 percent of the Fortune 100 use containers, and more than 50 percent of those companies already use Kubernetes for container orchestration.

We feel that this Cloud Native approach using Docker and Kubernetes is the starderized approach that is being adopted by all the major cloud players:
